# System Monitoring Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
The System Monitoring Dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights into system performance, resource usage, and alerts. The architecture is built on a microservices approach, leveraging a backend API and a responsive frontend interface.

## Architecture Components

### Backend
- **Framework**: The backend is built using Python with a web framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
- **Services**:
  - **Prometheus Service**: Interacts with Prometheus to fetch system metrics.
  - **Grafana Service**: Manages Grafana dashboards for visualizing metrics.
  - **AI Anomaly Detection Service**: Analyzes metrics for anomalies using AI algorithms.
- **Routes**:
  - **Metrics**: Handles requests related to system metrics.
  - **Alerts**: Manages alert configurations and notifications.
  - **Resources**: Provides information on resource usage.
  - **Reports**: Generates reports based on collected metrics and alerts.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: The frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic user interface.
- **Components**:
  - **Dashboard**: Main view displaying system metrics and alerts.
  - **Metrics Chart**: Visual representation of metrics data.
  - **Alerts Panel**: Displays current alerts and their statuses.
  - **Resource View**: Shows resource usage statistics.
  - **Theme Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
  - **AR Preview**: Provides augmented reality previews of system data.

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Both backend and frontend applications are containerized using Docker.
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container applications.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible is utilized for deployment automation and environment setup.

## Data Flow
1. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch metrics, alerts, and resource data.
2. The backend processes requests, interacts with Prometheus and Grafana, and returns the necessary data.
3. Alerts are generated based on predefined thresholds and are sent to the frontend for user notification.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable system monitoring solution, enabling users to monitor system performance effectively and respond to alerts in real-time.
